# ShoppingCartProject

## Overview

This Shopping Cart project is a web application created using Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS for web design, and SQL for the database. As part of my final project for the Java Full Stack Certification at Wiley Edge, I developed a comprehensive shopping cart system that incorporates user authentication, data storage for shopping carts, price calculations, and a record of previous purchases for each user.

## How to Run

To run the application:
1. Open the "ShoppingCartProject" folder.
2. Run "ShoppingCartProjectConsumerApplication."
3. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8082.

If needed, you can log in with the following credentials:
- Username: Alex
- Password: Azzopardi

If the login doesn't work, you can skip it by going directly to http://localhost:8082/menu.
